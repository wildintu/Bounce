                        We also know how much easier it is to bring a creative idea to life when you can bounce it off a fellow creative.
                        The big problem with that can be distance. It can be hard to brainstorm with your friend in Seattle when youâ€™re all the way in Austin and the best you can do to make up the distance is with a webcam.
                        This is where Bounce can come in. Using our poll to create a web of ideas, you can literally see your ideas come to life. </p>
